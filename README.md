# Features
## Passed
Passed is an app that automatically recognises if a mountain pass in Europe has already been crossed by you (with the bike obviously :D). If you want to know your Stats, switch the variable 'passed' to 1 (0 by default). Note: You also want to switch 'scrape' to 1 if you are running the script for the first time. This will scrape the pass data from qu√§ldich.de. The plot will appear in the plot folder.
