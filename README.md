# Features
## Passed
Passed is an app that automatically recognises if you have passed a mountain pass (with the bike obviously...). If you want to know your Stats, switch the variable 'passed' to 1 (0 by default). Note: You also want to switch 'scrape' to 1 to get fresh pass data. If switched on, this will scrape the pass data from qu√§ldich.de. The plot will appear in the plot folder.

## Ridges
More to come soon.
